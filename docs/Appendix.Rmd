### R Code ###

If you would like to run through all of the code examples in this documentation without having to 
pick out each line of code from the text, below are files with the R code for each section.  You can save
these files to your computer and open then in RStudio (or other text editor). 
If you're using RStudio server, upload these files from your computer to the server for
easy access.

- [Activity 1](scripts/Activity_1.R)
- [Activity 2](scripts/Activity_2.R)
- [Activity 3](scripts/Activity_3.R)
- [Activity 4](scripts/Activity_4.R)
- [Activity 2 Solutions](scripts/Activity_solutions_2.R)
- [Activity 3 Solutions](scripts/Activity_solutions_3.R)
- [Activity 4 Solutions](scripts/Activity_solutions_4.R)

### Data ###

The following data files are used in the activities: 

- [some_fake_data.csv](docs/some_fake_data.csv)
- [nf-week2-sample.csv](docs/nf-week2-sample.csv)

To save these files to your computer, right click on the link and choose `Save Link As...` (or something to that effect)

If you are using a server version of RStudio (running in a web browser), you'll need to upload the saved file
from your computer to the the RStudio server using the `Upload` button in the menu of the lower right
quadrant of RStudio.
